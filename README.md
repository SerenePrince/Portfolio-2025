## ‚ú® Features

- **React Components**: Sections like **Home**, **About**, **Experience**, **Projects**, and **Contact** are separate components, making the code modular and maintainable.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: The navigation bar dynamically highlights the current section and allows for smooth transitions between sections using React's state management.
- **Animations**: Each section uses fade-in animations from different directions (e.g., fade-in from left, right, top, bottom) to create a visually appealing effect.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring that the website looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
